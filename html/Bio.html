    I was born in Nampa, Idaho, the fifth of six (living) children. Nampa was great - I fought with my next-older
    sister; I hung out with my little brother, who is two years younger than me; and we spent most of our time doing
    things we weren't supposed to be doing - swimming in the canal our parents forbade us to go near, playing in the
    park without supervision (and occasionally mooning the neighbors), lighting fires in the school dumpsters, breaking
    windows - normal boy stuff.

    When I was 9, we started moving around - first to Moscow, ID for a year, then to Baker City, OR for two years, and
    finally to Spokane, WA, when I was twelve. We stayed in Spokane
